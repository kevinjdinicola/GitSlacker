GitSlacker is a Java application that can monitor changes
to GitHub repositories and post changes and updates
to configured slack channels.

Git slacker also supports basic message based about
the events that it reports.  For example:

When GitSlacker mentions that a commit was pushed,
you can say "what changed".  GitSlacker will then report
a list of files that were changed in that commit.

GitSlacker also understands messaging context.  If you
say "show me some/filename.java" after git slacker has
mentioned a commit that was pushed, it will give you
a link to access the file in question.

Git slacker was built upon the DropWizard framework to
allow the ability to easily add API endpoints in
the future for additional functionality.  DropWizard
also provides a convenient application base,
configuration provider, built in logging, and
lifecycle management, in addition to the ability to
add API endpoints.

Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------

Configuration is simple.  GitSlacker will need to access
your GitHub repositories (which may be private) so you'll
need to provide GitSlacker with credentials for GitHub
bit filling out these fields in the config:

githubUsername: username
githubPassword: password

GitSlacker also needs access to your slack instance, so
you will need to provide a bot api-key for GitSlacker
to use.

slackApiKey: some-long-slack-api-key

GitSlacker needs to know what repositories you want it
to monitor, and what channels it should report about
them in. (make sure to invite gitslacker to those
channels in Slack!)


watchedRepositories:
  - repositoryName: kevinjdinicola/githubapitest
    channelName: dev
  - repositoryName: kevinjdinicola/GitSlacker
    channelName: other-dev

Lastly, GitSlacker supports mapping from GitHub logins
to slack handles.  There is no way to infer what a user's
slack handle might be from their GitHub info, so you can
specify them in a relationship in the config, like so.

userMap:
  - githubLogin: kevinjdinicola
    slackName: kevin
